                    I am new to Crypto…how can I get involved?
                </summary>

                    If you are all new to Crypto, the first step is to make yourself with some ETH (Etherium, the second largest Crypto currency) . The easiest is to exchange USD , EUR , or any FIAT currency via credit card or bank transfer at one of the major exchanges like Coinbase , Binance , Kraken , etc. Once you receive your ETH in your exchange account, we recommend to transfer the ETH to your own wallet . Since for further transactions a MetaMask wallet comes very handy, this would be our wallet of choice. After transferring the ETH to your MetaMask wallet , you are ready to go. Just click on “get Passport” to purchase your choice of Passport on OpenSea.

                NFT stands for “Non-fungible token” and is a unique, one-of-a-kind digital item that users can buy, own, and trade. Use cases are digital art, digital stamps, digital land, etc. Our NFTs are like a rare piece of art that can also act as a “timeshare membership” card which gets you access to the resort and community exclusives.
