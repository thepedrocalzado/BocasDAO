                If you are all new to Crypto, the first step is to make yourself with some ETH (Etherium, the second largest Crypto currency). The easiest is to exchange USD, EUR, or any FIAT currency via credit card or bank transfer at one of the major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.
                Once you receive your ETH in your exchange account, we recommend to transfer the ETH to your own wallet.
                Since for further transactions a MetaMask wallet comes very handy, this would be our wallet of choice.
                After transferring the ETH to your MetaMask wallet, you are ready to go. Just click on “get Passport” to purchase your choice of Passport on OpenSea.
