    "# FAQS #":"",
    "Faqs-title":"Frequently Asked Questions",
    "Faqs-1":"I am new to Crypto…how can I get involved?",
    "Faqs-1-desc":"If you are all new to Crypto, the first step is to make yourself with some ETH (Etherium, the second largest Crypto currency) . The easiest is to exchange USD , EUR , or any FIAT currency via credit card or bank transfer at one of the major exchanges like Coinbase , Binance , Kraken , etc. Once you receive your ETH in your exchange account, we recommend to transfer the ETH to your own wallet . Since for further transactions a MetaMask wallet comes very handy, this would be our wallet of choice. After transferring the ETH to your MetaMask wallet , you are ready to go. Just click on “get Passport” to purchase your choice of Passport on OpenSea.",
